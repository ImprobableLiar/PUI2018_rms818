## Assignment One
Generated 100 samples of different sizes with N> 10 & N>1000, with 5 different distributions.
Distributions used were: Normal (Gaussian), Poisson, Binomial, Chi-squared, LogNormal
Extra Credit: Fitted a Gaussian to the distribution of mean (LogNormal) graph

## Assignment Two
Downloaded the Citibike data provided and chose an interesting hypothesis to formulate.
Question formulated: Do men cycle longer distances compared to women? Null hypothesis was set up as: H0 - The cycling trip duration for females on average is the same or longer as compared to males.

## Assignment Three
Completed assignment 3 using Z-test to understand if the implementation of an alternative bus route for bus line X8 improves circulation.
Z-score reflected a 2.56 which was more than 0.05 thus rejecting the null hypothesis.

All three assignments were done and discussed collaboratively with Klo'e, Qinyu and Vaidehi in group discussions (and some other people who were in the same working space!)
